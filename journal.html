	Journal entry #1:
	In the first couple of weeks of  CS1, we have learned how to code with the program sublime text and different methods of coding through that. I have learned how to adjusted the background, or different things you can put on your website such as shapes, etc. Through making those shapes, I have learned how to adjust size, color, and even images. I learned how to do my person card, and I have two gifs while using the hover function. I also learned how to add text and how to add links/make different sections by using different tags opening and closing. I am excited to get into the more design part of the website in the next few weeks to come.

	Journal entry #2:
	In the 4th week of CS1, I have managed to make a homepage! All the pages of my website now link to eachother, and the sites are all functioning. My home homepage is coded with hover skills, background colors, text colors, and text size. I had to test out many different layouts to see what I would like, and see what would make my website feel like one cohesive(functional) design. I worked really hard on it, and I really like how it turned out. I am having a little trouble figuring out how to get it online, but I want to keep trying and I think I will use some of the videos to see.

Journal entry #3:
	For this CS1 hw, I made my first animation. It is 3 squares that move in a square pattern. While they are moving in the square pattern, they are also shifiting colors, but they stay the same size. I decided to make it because I wanted to make something that matched the color scheme of my homepage, while trying to make a simple first animation. I think my codeworks by being dependent on the position being relative. If it didn't have that, it wouldn't move, creating only a slight animation(the colors changing). If it didn't go infinitley, then it also wouldn't do what I want it to do(which is to keep going). I want to try and keep playing around with it to see if I can stagger the squares to make the second start a little after the first, and make the third start a little after the second.
