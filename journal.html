	In the first couple of weeks of CS1, we have learned how to code with the program sublime text and different methods of coding through that. I have learned how to adjusted the background, or different things you can put on your website such as shapes, etc. Through making those shapes, I have learned how to adjust size, color, and even images. I learned how to do my person card, and I have two gifs while using the hover function. I also learned how to add text and how to add links/make different sections by using different tags opening and closing. I am excited to get into the more design part of the website in the next few weeks to come.

In the 4th week of CS1, I have managed to make a homepage! All the pages of my website now link to eachother, and the sites are all functioning. My home homepage is coded with hover skills, background colors, text colors, and text size. I had to test out many different layouts to see what I would like, and see what would make my website feel like one cohesive(functional) design. I worked really hard on it, and I really like how it turned out. I am having a little trouble figuring out how to get it online, but I want to keep trying and I think I will use some of the videos to see.

For this CS1 hw, I made my first animation. It is 3 squares that move in a square pattern. While they are moving in the square pattern, they are also shifiting colors, but they stay the same size. I decided to make it because I wanted to make something that matched the color scheme of my homepage, while trying to make a simple first animation. I think my codeworks by being dependent on the position being relative. If it didn't have that, it wouldn't move, creating only a slight animation(the colors changing). If it didn't go infinitley, then it also wouldn't do what I want it to do(which is to keep going). I want to try and keep playing around with it to see if I can stagger the squares to make the second start a little after the first, and make the third start a little after the second.

In the week of 11/7, I have done a lot with my website on my own! I made an animation of three people cliff jumping with a link back to my home page through the image of a sun and I did it myself using the code I learned from class. I also had  Tara help me with making something that clicks and changes images. In class on 11/10, I made another javascript function using Event Listener and I have a div that moves around on the screen and it centers itself. I made a mouse follower myself it has an image that follows my mouse around the screen!

I did a new project! These journal entries aren't as structured s I originally wanted them, and they're not consistant but I'm chilling. Today is 12/14/22, and it's the last semifinal round of the 2022 World Cup(Morocco vs France). For this project, I used event listener to create a div that would follow your mouse around on the screen. My div is an image of Zendaya, because she is my favorite actress, and I felt like using a photo of her. I used eventclient because then it move the mouse along the screen, and it has the div follow it. I'm working on a lot more projects right now, and that's pretty much the update for today!

It's still 12/14/22, and I have some more projects that I've done. Molly showed us how to use music and audio tags, and I have loved using that to make more websites. I made a birthday card for my sister, and it changes the background when I click, and it also has the div of it a cute image saying happy birthday in a cute photo. When I click and it changes the background, I also added something so that it plays and pauses a song that I picked for the card. I'm currently working on a square arry project, a drawing project(which is really hard), and a litle gift project! That's pretty much it for now!
