	Journal entry #1:
	In the first couple of weeks of  CS1, we have learned how to code with the program sublime text and different methods of coding through that. I have learned how to adjusted the background, or different things you can put on your website such as shapes, etc. Through making those shapes, I have learned how to adjust size, color, and even images. I learned how to do my person card, and I have two gifs while using the hover function. I also learned how to add text and how to add links/make different sections by using different tags opening and closing. I am excited to get into the more design part of the website in the next few weeks to come.

	Journal entry #2:
	In the 4th week of CS1, I have managed to make a homepage! All the pages of my website now link to eachother, and the sites are all functioning. My home homepage is coded with hover skills, background colors, text colors, and text size. I had to test out many different layouts to see what I would like, and see what would make my website feel like one cohesive(functional) design. I worked really hard on it, and I really like how it turned out. I am having a little trouble figuring out how to get it online, but I want to keep trying and I think I will use some of the videos to see.
